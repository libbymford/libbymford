# SOAN 265: Exploring Social Networks

## Course Overview
This course introduced network analysis using R, focusing on how network structures affect individualsâ€™ access to information, social capital, and mobilization potential. Key learning objectives included:

- Basic network descriptive statistics
- Network visualization
- Community detection and subgroups identification
- Introduction to statistical models of network structure (Exponential Random Graph Models - ERGMs)

## Key Learnings
- First exposure to R programming and network analysis
- Computed network metrics such as size, density, diameter, and transitivity
- Created and analyzed adjacency matrices and edge lists
- Visualized networks with node attributes using `statnet`, `UserNetR`, and `tidyverse`
- Applied ERGMs to analyze network structures (though initial understanding was limited)

## Challenges & Growth
- Initially struggled with understanding network analysis concepts and statistical modeling
- Developed persistence and problem-solving skills by repeatedly debugging and refining code
- Learned to appreciate the iterative nature of data science and statistical modeling

## Final Project
The final project incorporated all course concepts and focused on analyzing a fictional social network (Hunger Games universe). Key aspects included:
- Creating and refining network visualizations
- Computing centrality measures (degree, closeness, betweenness)
- Experimenting with ERGMs to understand strategic ties, romantic relationships, and friendships

Reflecting on this project, I realize my initial interpretations of ERGMs were flawed. However, this experience laid the foundation for future coursework and deepened my interest in data science.
