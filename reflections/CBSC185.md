# CBSC 185: Introduction to Data Science - Trends Over Time

## Course Overview
This course provided an introduction to data science techniques, focusing on analyzing trends in longitudinal data. The key learning objectives included:

- Organizing and managing data efficiently in R
- Creating effective data visualizations
- Conducting statistical analyses, including repeated measures ANOVA and linear mixed effects regression models (LMERs)
- Understanding how to analyze trends in longitudinal data

## Key Learnings
- Strengthened data wrangling skills, including filtering, subsetting, and pivoting data
- Gained experience with handling missing data and ensuring data integrity
- Learned how to conduct correlation tests and apply LMERs to analyze time-based data
- Developed effective data visualizations to communicate insights clearly

## Challenges & Growth
- Initially struggled with understanding longitudinal data structures and how to manage repeated measures
- Gained confidence in using R for time-series analysis and visualization
- Improved ability to interpret statistical models and present findings concisely

## Final Project
For my final project, I explored the relationship between physical activity, mood, and sleep among students over the course of a semester. Key tasks included:
- Cleaning and transforming survey data collected from the class
- Creating visualizations to show trends in mood and sleep patterns
- Conducting correlation tests and LMERs to analyze the impact of physical activity on well-being

This project reinforced my ability to work with real-world longitudinal data and apply statistical models to uncover meaningful insights.
