# SOAN 218: Basic Statistics in the Social Sciences

## Course Overview
This course introduced foundational statistical concepts and their applications in social science research. The key learning objectives included:

- Understanding basic statistical literacy and interpreting published statistical analyses
- Computing and interpreting summary descriptive statistics
- Conducting multiple regression analyses with continuous and dichotomous response variables
- Designing and evaluating research studies for causal inference

## Key Learnings
- Developed a strong foundation in statistical thinking and causal analysis
- Learned to compute summary statistics and visualize data distributions using `ggplot2`
- Gained hands-on experience with multiple regression modeling and hypothesis testing
- Applied statistical reasoning to evaluate the internal and external validity of research studies

## Challenges & Growth
- Initially struggled with conceptualizing causal relationships and confounding variables
- Developed a systematic approach to interpreting regression coefficients and statistical outputs
- Improved my ability to explain statistical findings in a clear and meaningful way

## Final Project
The final project required analyzing a dataset to predict studentsâ€™ final exam scores based on midterm performance. Key tasks included:
- Cleaning and preparing data in R
- Computing correlation coefficients and interpreting their significance
- Fitting linear regression models and visualizing results with fitted trend lines

This course provided a crucial foundation for my data science journey, reinforcing my ability to think critically about statistical analyses and apply these methods in more advanced coursework.
