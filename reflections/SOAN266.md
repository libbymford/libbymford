# SOAN 266: Neighborhoods and Inequality

## Course Overview
This course explored how residential contexts shape social inequalities, focusing on spatial data analysis and regression modeling in R. Key learning objectives included:

- Creating maps and spatial visualizations using R
- Conducting spatial regression models
- Understanding how space impacts social and economic inequalities
- Building a research project based on spatial data analysis

## Key Learnings
- Used `ggplot2` to visualize spatial data across census tracts
- Joined and cleaned external datasets (e.g., ACS, crime data, historical redlining maps)
- Developed skills in spatial regression modeling, although initial interpretations were flawed
- Identified relationships between historical redlining, crime rates, and gentrification trends in Denver

## Challenges & Growth
- Struggled with properly interpreting regression coefficients and understanding causality
- Learned how to manipulate large datasets and deal with geospatial joins
- Gained confidence in conducting independent data-driven research

## Final Project
**[Link to Final Project](projects/SOAN266.pdf)**

My final project investigated how historical redlining shaped racial and economic disparities in Denver. Key analyses included:
- Mapping redlined areas and overlaying them with crime and socioeconomic data
- Running spatial regressions to examine how past redlining predicted poverty and racial composition
- Identifying gentrification patterns in areas with high marijuana-related arrests before legalization

This project strengthened my ability to apply data science to social science research and prepared me for more advanced spatial modeling in future projects.
