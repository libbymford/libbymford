# Ethical Responsibilities in Data Science

Throughout my coursework in the Data Science Minor, I have come to understand the ethical responsibilities that come with working with data. Protecting subjects and ensuring transparency are not just theoretical ideals but essential practices that shape how data is collected, analyzed, and shared. 

## Key Learnings

- **Honesty and Reproducibility:** I have learned that honesty and reproducibility are crucial - not only to maintain integrity in my own work but also to contribute meaningfully to the broader scientific community.
  
- **Clear, Well-Documented Code:** Writing clear, well-documented code has been a key part of every project, reinforcing the importance of making my work understandable and replicable.

- **Duties Beyond Technical Accuracy:** Beyond technical accuracy, I now recognize that data scientists have a duty not only to the individuals and entities from whom data is collected but also to the public. How data is presented can influence policies, perceptions, and real-world decisions, making it critical to avoid bias and misrepresentation.

## Moving Forward

These lessons have shaped how I approach data, and I know they will continue to guide me as I advance in my career.
